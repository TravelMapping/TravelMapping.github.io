    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
 <p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p>

    <p><span style="color: red">The hardware has arrived for memory and disk
upgrades to the server that houses TM and METAL.  I hope to install
them this week, possibly as soon as tomorrow (Wed 1/20).  There will
be multiple complete outages of TM and METAL, including the forum.
Watch <a
href="https://forum.travelmapping.net/index.php?topic=4052.msg21811">this
forum thread</a>, the motd on the main TM page, and this page
for updates.</span></p>
