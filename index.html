    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    <p>Siena College will be performing maintenance and upgrades on the campus network all day on December 21.  This could result in some short (highly likely) or more lengthy (less likely) network disruptions for the TM server's network connection.  We are fortunate that the server is in the main machine room, meaning any disruption there would affect core services to the campus, so the work will be coordinated to minimize such disruptions.</p>
 <p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p>
