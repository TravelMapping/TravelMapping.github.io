    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    
    <p style="color:red"><b>The TM server failed to boot up during its operating system upgrade on the evening of December 17.  It should be back at some point on December 18.</b></p>

    <p>The server that houses TM is currently being moved to a more secure location with
better backup power and air conditioning.  The reliability
benefits of being in a genuine dedicated machine room should far
outweigh the inconvenience of this interruption.  We have no estimate yet of time to restoration of services.<br />
