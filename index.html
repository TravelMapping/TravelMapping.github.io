    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    <p style="color: red">Travel Mapping will be temporarily inaccessible on July 19 due server OS & software upgrades.  
      TM services are currently offline due to a problem with starting the mysql server after the upgrade.   No restoration time estimate yet, but I will access to the server console after 1:30 PM EDT to track things down.</p>
  <!-- <p>Travel Mapping's main site is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p> -->
