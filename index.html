    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    
 <p>Travel Mapping's server	was experiencing intermittent network problems for the first couple days of August. It should be fixed now.
   
   <br />
Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.
