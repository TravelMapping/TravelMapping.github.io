    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>

    <p>The server that houses TM will be moved to a more secure location with
better backup power and air conditioning on Tuesday, December 18.  The
server will need to be down for at least 30 minutes, possibly much
longer if things don't go as smoothly as expected.  The reliability
benefits of being in a genuine dedicated machine room should far
outweigh the inconvenience of this hopefully brief interruption.<br />
Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p>
