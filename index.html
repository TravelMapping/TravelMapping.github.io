    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    
<p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.
    </p> 

    <p><b>Notice</b>: Siena College has scheduled a major power reconfiguration/upgrade for the entire day on Saturday, July 13. 
      Part of this process requires rewiring both the main and the backup power in the machine room where TM's server and
      the campus network backbone hardware are located. Expect no TM/METAL for at least that entire day. It's possible
      I'll need to shut down the servers Friday, July 12, and not get them back online until Monday, July 15, but I hope
      I will have access to the machine room on Saturday morning and evening to minimize the downtime.</p>
