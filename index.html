    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    
<!-- <p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.
    </p> -->

    <p><b>Notice</b>: Siena College is currently undergoing a major power reconfiguration/upgrade, which includes
      rewiring both the main and the backup power in the machine room where TM's server and
      the campus network backbone hardware are located.  If all goes
      according to plan, the server will come back up when the power is restored late in the day on July 13.  
      If there are problems, service would
      not be restored until I get gain access to the machine room, which might not be until Monday, July 15.</p>
