    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    <!-- <p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p> -->
    <p>A minor operating system upgrade on the TM server on 5/29 unexpectedly removed the database version we were using.  
      TM itself should be mostly back to normal now on both the Highways and Rail sides.  The new database feels a little slower.  Optimizations may need to be applied to
 take better advantage of the new version.  The forum has been restored.  Everything should be back except any forum posts between the backup that ran at 3 AM EDT on 5/29 and the time the database went away.  Thank you for your patience.</p>
