    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    
   <p><span style="color:red">Travel Mapping's server suffered an extended outage from the evening of September 7 to the morning of September 8.  The server is also used for class work, and it appears some student programs got out of control creating processes, resulting in the system running out of processes and memory.  All should be back to normal now.</span></p>
 <p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p>
