    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    
   <p>TM's server is currently not responding.  It is likely due to an out of control student program creating processes.  It will be back as soon as that problem can be resolved.  Unfortnuately, this is unlikely to happen before Tuesday morning.</p>
 <!-- p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p -->
