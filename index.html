    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    <p style="color: red">The the travelmapping.net domain is currently inaccessible to many due to a DNS configuration problem.  
      The problem has been identified and will be fixed soon.  It might take some time for the fix to propagate to name servers that have
      cached the problematic information.  For now, you should be able to access the <a href="https://tmstage.teresco.org/">staging site</a> 
      and have access to most main site functionality.</p>
 <!-- <p>Travel Mapping's main site is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p> -->
