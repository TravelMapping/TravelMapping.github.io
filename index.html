    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>

    <p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p>

    <p>The Siena College data center, where the server that houses TM and METAL is located, is scheduled for some major maintenance and upgrades on Sunday, July 13, from 6-11 AM EDT.  Expect network disruptions to the TM/METAL server any time within that window.</p>
