    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    <p>The server that hosts TM and METAL will have
its operating system and other system software updated on Monday, July
18, starting at about 10 AM EDT.  The whole process should take an
hour or two. If all goes well, you'll barely notice, with only some
brief outages to boot into a new kernel and restart
various updated system services for software updates that will follow
the OS update.  There's always the chance of complications and a more
      lengthy outage.</p>
    <p>Travel Mapping's main site is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p>
