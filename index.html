    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    <!-- <p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p> -->
    <p>The area where the Travel Mapping server is housed is experiencing power fluctuations, making the network inaccessible.  We expect TM services to return to normal when the power situation stabilizes.</p>
