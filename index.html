    <p>This site is maintained as a place where users and contributors
    to the Travel Mapping project can find information in the event
      that the project's main server is offline.</p>

    <h3>Project Status</h3>
    <p>An update to the latest operating system and other software the TM
server is planned for Tuesday, June 10.  Hopefully this will be nearly
unnoticeable to TM and METAL users and contributors, with just a few
brief outages as the server reboots.  However, with any major upgrade
there is a higher chance that something breaks and a more lengthy
downtime could result.  Check here for status updates if the TM and the TM Forum
    become unavailable.</p>
    <p>Travel Mapping is operating normally to the best of our knowledge.</p>
